	    <h3>Geologic Thin Sections</h3>
	    <p>"A thin section is a 30 Âµm (= 0.03 mm) thick slice of rock attached to a glass slide with epoxy. Typical thin section slides are 26 mm x 46 mm, although larger ones can be produced. They are generally covered by another glass slide, a cover slip also attached to the rock with epoxy." - http://geology.wwu.edu/dept/faculty/hirschd/other/thinsections/
