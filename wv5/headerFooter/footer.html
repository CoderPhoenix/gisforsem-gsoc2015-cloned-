	    <h3>Data Science</h3>
	    <p>"Data science is the study of the generalizable extraction of knowledge from data,[1] yet the key word is science.[2] It incorporates varying elements and builds on techniques and theories from many fields, including signal processing, mathematics, probability models, machine learning, statistical learning, computer programming, data engineering, pattern recognition and learning, visualization, uncertainty modeling, data warehousing, and high performance computing with the goal of extracting meaning from data and creating data products. The subject is not restricted to only big data, although the fact that data is scaling up makes big data an important aspect of data science. Another key ingredient that boosted the practice and applicability of data science is the development of machine learning - a branch of artificial intelligence - which is used to uncover patterns from data and develop practical and usable predictive models." - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science
